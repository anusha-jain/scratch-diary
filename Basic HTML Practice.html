out to describe the image you upload
you need it otherwise webpages won't function properly-->

<!--a title nested in paragraphs can be seen by holding the mouse over the text-->
<p title="Information can be embedded in the value of text too"> For more information, use

<!--the tag <a></a> is used for links with the link INSIDE the tag-->
<!--href is an attribute of the <a> tag which adds extra info to the section-->
</p>

<p style="font-size:20px">Consider changing the text style for emphasis or
to stylise the file. <br>The inclusion of breaks and spacing of the text is helpful</p>

<!--the <pre> tag gives a set format to the text with set separation and Courier font-->
